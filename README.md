## Introduction

This repository serves as a personal archive and reference for TypeScript, showcasing everything I've learned, implemented, and experimented with. From basic types and interfaces to advanced features like generics, decorators, and TypeScript with React and Node.js, this project follows a non-standard path that fits my learning style.

## Roadmap

Below is a high-level roadmap of topics covered in this repository. Note that these sections are organized based on my learning preferences, not as a recommended sequence:

1. **Basics**
   - Types, Interfaces, Classes, Functions
2. **Intermediate**
   - Generics, Advanced Types, Type Guards, Decorators
3. **Advanced**
   - Utility Types, Mapped Types, Conditional Types, Modules and Namespaces
4. **React with TypeScript**
   - Basic Components, Props and State with TypeScript
5. **Node.js with TypeScript**
   - Building a basic HTTP server with TypeScript
